   --    - Asynchronous.Events provides single-shot events as a synchronization primitive between tasks.
   --    - Asynchronous.Tasks provides an interface for user-defined asynchronous tasks.
   --    - Asynchronous.Executors provides a mean to run such asynchronous tasks.
   --    - Asynchronous.Utilities provides some basic infrastructure for these facilities.
